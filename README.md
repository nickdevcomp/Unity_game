# C# Horror Quest

## Plot
After a boring calculus lecture, our hero is too tired to take the stairs to the ground floor, so he decides to take the elevator. This will be a humorous floor with various Easter eggs, maybe even a mini-game. We can also add some signs, like quotes from professors on our floor. If the player wants to take the stairs, we should respond with something like: "Hey, I'm too tired, I'll take the elevator instead."

The elevator unexpectedly breaks down and transports the hero not to the ground floor, but to the -1 floor. There's no light, and we can only move around by the light of our phone's flashlight. This floor needs to be something eerie.

## Locations
1. **Elevator**: 
A portable location. The player will stand in the elevator with pleasant, unobtrusive music playing. Lots of people will enter and exit on each floor. We need to make an icon for the current floor. Make it so we can't exit the elevator prematurely (perhaps make it seem like a crowd pushes him back).
   
2. **MatMech, 6th floor**.
   
3. **Location: 52nd floor**: 
If we die, we end up on the 52nd floor. Here, we can drink kvass. And that's it. We can't descend from it.
   
4. **-1st Floor**.
